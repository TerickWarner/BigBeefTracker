Keep track of who had an NBA big beef (20+ rebounds)

As an avid fan of No Dunks Podcast I wanted to create a way to track if anybody in the NBA got a big beef. 

The idea is to run it once every night around 2 a.m ET and tweet each player who scored 20+ rebounds after each game has been played. This program utilizes the NBA API built by Swar.
